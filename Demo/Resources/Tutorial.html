<div><br /></div>
<div>1. To enter text, simply write horizontally anywhere on the screen in your preferred handwriting style. You can write one or more words per recognition session, but always complete the entire word in each session because the dictionary is used to find best results. When you stop writing for longer than the Recognition Delay time, handwriting will be converted to the digital text, which will appear at the current cursor location. You can use the Return gesture instead of waiting for the recognition delay to speed up text entry. If you make a mistake use the long Backspace gesture to delete the last stroke or the Cut gesture to cancel the current recognition session. If you always print, you may want to enable the Separate Letters option.</div>
