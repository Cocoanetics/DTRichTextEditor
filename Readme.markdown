DTRichTextEditor
================

This project aims to provide a replacement for Apple's severely limited `UITextView` and to allow for editing attributed strings. It consists of the following parts:

- DTLoupe - showing a magnifying glass that closesly resembles Apple's built-in original
- DTWebArchive - this is the way how rich text is represented on the `UIPasteboard`
- DTCoreText - parsing HTML, generating NSAttributedString instances, displaying attributed strings, creating HTML
- DTFoundation - several helper methods
